Can someone approve the workflows so I can get feedback from the whole matrix?

My apologies for the delay Fabien, my OSS time was very limited lately I totally forgot to get back on this PR.
Could you please rebase?

ping @fbourigault @chalasr

I think this still is a valuable addition, any updates on this?

I've rebased this PR and applied changes from LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle.

@fbourigault Apologies for the delay here. I'm wiling to move forward :) Can you please have a look at failing tests?
