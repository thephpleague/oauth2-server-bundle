Thank you for the PR! This looks good to me.
If you can look into the failing tests, that'd be awesome. Otherwise, I'll have a look this week.

The test were already failing in the master branch for me.
Not sure why it didn't show up in the pipeline of the latest commit to master.

Indeed, I'm fixing the broken tests in #44 so don't worry about the ones that were breaking before your PR.

Out of curiosity, which Symfony version are you using with this bundle?
I'm tempted to bump the minimum version to 5.3 since 5.2 is not maintained anymore.

I am using Symfony 5.3. I agree with 5.2, it is already EOL.
