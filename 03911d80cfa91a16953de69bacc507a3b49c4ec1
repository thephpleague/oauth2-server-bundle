Can you rebase your PR and add a test case for this?

Yes, will do. Please allow me some days to get back to this! ðŸ˜„

Hey @chalasr I'm honestly struggling to execute the PHPUnit tests locally.

Any tips, guide or README I can consult?

@fschmtt Here you go, https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server-bundle/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#testing.
Please tell me if it's not enough

Hey thanks for your reply. I got the local setup for running the tests working.

I suppose you'd like me to to test that setting the option in the YAML configuration properly configures the `AuthorizationServer`, am I correct?

I'm not super familiar with testing a bundle or its configuration and couldn't find a similar test case, so I'm a bit at loss how and where to start ðŸ˜… I'd appreciate a helping hand if possible.

Oh wait, I overlooked the `ExtensionTest`, which seems what I should have been looking for!
