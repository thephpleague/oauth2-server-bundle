Is it a use case of yours? I think I prefer to be pragmatic and not complicate the setup unless someone actually complains about it

I added the bundle to a small app without any doctrine package, which got me wondering if we should make this change before 1.0, but I'm OK with your pragmatic point of view

Thinking twice about it, the 98% use case probably installs the ORM first so I'm fine with this.
