@chalasr Allow me to tag you here. Could you enable the workflows to run?

The package `symfony/doctrine-bridge` versions `6.4` and above [conflict](https://github.com/symfony/doctrine-bridge/blob/e4fb1e141b00cee5de8b8a2fe7008301b6b4dabd/composer.json#L55) with `doctrine/orm` version `2.14.*`. Removed those combinations from the GitHub workflows.

Fixed the errors thrown by psalm and php-cs-fixer.

When to expect the new release?  I've saw that all tests are passed.
