👍 for this, though the failing test seems related isn't it? Can you please have a look?
I'd like to tag v1.0 stable after merging this one. /cc @ro0NL

Failure is not related actually. I'm going to have a look asap, help welcome.

Failure fixed, rebase needed :)

Hey, thanks for the test fix. It seems to have improved a lot but not all the way. Looking at your PR for the fix, that's also not green yet.

Remaining failures need some work to go away, not right now :) Can you add a test case for this?

Added an acceptance test.

I had a bit of struggles with the cache in `/tests/.kernel`. Changing the TestKernel configuration was ignored by the existing cache. I added separate cache directories for when TestKernel configuration is given. Let me know if you agree with this approach, or you have another suggestion :).

@frankdekker Already suffered from this as well, we should do something to improve the situation. All good here
