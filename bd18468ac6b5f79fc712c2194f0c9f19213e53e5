Can we get this merged? @chalasr
I am directly looking for that, to get https://github.com/steverhoades/oauth2-openid-connect-server working.

Otherwise there is not suitable way to inject a custom `ResponseTypeInterface` into the `AuthorizationServer`.

I'm waiting for the `(draft)` to be removed from the PR title :)

Dunno why the GHA builds didn't run though

Removed it :)
Should I apply the fix by @mrardon or do you add it?
And why the laugh @mrardon ?

Thanks!
Given this is open for more than a year, I’ll happily take care of making the change if you don’t (+ rebase to trigger the CI)
